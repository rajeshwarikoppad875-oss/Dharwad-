        <h4>Maize 🌽</h4>
        <p>Maize is a significant crop in the Dharwad region of Karnataka, a state that ranks among India's top maize producers. The local economy benefits from maize, which is a versatile crop used for food, animal feed, and as a raw material for various industries like starch and pharmaceuticals. Dharwad is also home to the Karnataka State Seeds Corporation’s Varietal Research & Development Center, which focuses on creating high-yield hybrid maize varieties to support local farmers and enhance productivity in the region</p>

        <h4>Jowar (Sorghum) 🌾</h4>
        <p>Jowar, also known as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and referred to as "Jola" in Kannada, is a vital crop in the Dharwad region and northern Karnataka. It is particularly significant as a rainfed crop grown primarily in the rabi season in this area, thriving in the heavy black soils after the monsoon retreats. While jowar has historically been a staple food for most families in the region, the area under cultivation has been shrinking due to various factors like labor shortages and consumer preference for specific traditional varieties.</p>

        <h4>Groundnut 🥜</h4>
        <p>Groundnut cultivation is significant in Dharwad, though it can be impacted by weather variability. Farmers in the district cultivate varieties like G2-52, alongside other crops like soya and channa, with some areas reporting good yields despite drought conditions in other years. The Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Dharwad has promoted improved practices for this crop, leading to higher yields and disease resistance in demonstration plots. The region is also a source for groundnut seeds, with the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad contributing to the production of these planting materials. </p>

        <h4>Cotton 🌿</h4>
        <p>Cotton is a prominent commercial fiber crop in the Dharwad district of Karnataka, playing a vital role in the regional agricultural economy. It is primarily cultivated in the deeper black soils found in areas like Hubli, Kalgatagi, and Dharwad taluks, which are well-suited to the crop's growth requirements. The district has seen increasing trends in area, production, and productivity of cotton over the years, though a previous decline in area was noted due to factors like district subdivision and unstable prices.</p>

        <h4>Pulses 🫘</h4>
        <p>Pulses are a vital part of agriculture and nutrition in the Dharwad region, and across Karnataka. The area is home to the ICAR-IIPR Regional Research Station, which focuses on research and development of various pulses, including chickpea, lentil, and pigeon pea (tur/arhar). Pulses in Dharwad are predominantly grown under rainfed conditions, often on marginal lands, contributing to soil health through atmospheric nitrogen fixation. This practice helps in reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers, making the farming system more sustainable and environmentally friendly.</p>

        <h4>Chilli🌶️</h4>
        <p>Dharwad is a major cultivation hub for the Bydagi chilli, a variety known for its less pungent flavor and deep red color, which is designated as a Geographical Indication (GI) commodity. The crop is primarily cultivated in the rainfed districts of Karnataka, including Dharwad, Gadag, and Haveri. During the harvesting season from January to May, farmers often take their produce to the Bydagi market to ensure a fair price due to its well-established business culture. The region's climate and soil are suitable for the rainfed cultivation of this specific chilli variety. </p>
